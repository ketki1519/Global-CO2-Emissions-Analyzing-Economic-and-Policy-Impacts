## Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis
A data-driven project analyzing the key drivers of CO₂ emissions per capita across countries using regression modeling. This project was completed as part of an academic assignment and aims to uncover economic and policy-related factors that influence a country’s environmental footprint.

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between carbon emissions and a set of economic, demographic, and energy-related variables. Using a curated dataset, we apply regression techniques to:
1) Identify statistically significant predictors of CO₂ emissions
2) Evaluate model performance and robustness
3) Offer potential policy insights based on results

## Objective 
To build a predictive and interpretable regression model that identifies the most impactful variables influencing a country's CO₂ emissions, helping inform real-world sustainability strategies.
